>  ***Note**:*

>  -  *Only members are allowed to perform real staking, which deducts USDT. Admins do not have permission to add real staking for member.  
>   -  *Only admins are allowed to perform free staking for member. Members cannot add free staking for themselves.
>   -  Start from 10-02-2025, staking will separate 2 different staking type; Hash Mining & Liquidity Mining. Hash Mining stake by Meets value and Liquidity Mining stake by USDT.
>   -  Current Hash Mining will distribute bonuses for Staking Direct Sponsor and Staking Overriding in Meets tokens, as the staking is done using Meets tokens. Previously, both bonuses were distributed only in USDT until February 11, 2025.
>   -  The new Liquidity Mining will distribute bonuses for Staking Direct Sponsor and Staking Overriding in USDT.   

  
##  3) Nodes
Each node costs $3000, and a member can only have one node, either a free one or a purchased one.
>  ***Note**:*

>  -  *When a member buys a node, they receive 3000 in free staking. Free nodes do not include the 3000 staking.
>   -  *Once a user has a purchased or free node, they become eligible to collect the Nodes Investment bonus, calculated on the first day of each month. For example, if a user buys a node on November 8th, they qualify for the bonus when calculated on December 1st, as only 23 days have passed (less than the 30-day limit). This allows them to receive the bonus for all of December. If 30 days have passed, eligibility for the bonus depends on achieving a minimum of $5000 in small zone sales.
